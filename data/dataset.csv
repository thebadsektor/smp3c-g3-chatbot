What information is included in the counseling appointment specifics?,"The counseling appointment specifics include important details about the client that are necessary for scheduling and conducting virtual counseling. This may include the client's name, age, gender, address, contact numbers, emergency contact person, hardware to be used (e.g., cellphone, laptop), internet provider, and alternative contact numbers."
How is the performance of student interns monitored and evaluated?," The performance of student interns is monitored and evaluated by both LSPU (the university) and the Host Training Establishment (HTE). The SIPP coordinator, along with the dean of the LSPU college, utilizes standard procedures, instruments, and methodologies to assess the student interns. These may include oral and written observations, monthly reports, interviews, or conferences with the students."
What is the purpose of the briefing phase in virtual counseling?,"The purpose of the briefing phase in virtual counseling is to provide important information and guidelines to both the counselor and the client regarding the virtual counseling process. This phase includes discussions on various aspects such as time management, protocols, dos and don'ts during virtual counseling sessions, as well as briefing on informed consent and data privacy."
Why is it important to establish a specific time frame for the counseling process?,"Establishing a specific time frame for the counseling process is important to ensure that both the counselor and the client have clear boundaries and expectations regarding the duration of the session. By setting a specific time frame, it helps the counselor manage their schedule and availability, and it allows the client to plan their time accordingly. It promotes efficiency and helps maintain a structured and focused counseling session."
How should counselors handle late clients during virtual counseling sessions?,"Counselors should consider a leeway or grace period for late clients, typically around half an hour. If a client arrives within the given leeway, the counselor can proceed with the session.

By having intervals, counselors can ensure that they are fully present and prepared to provide quality counseling services to each client."
How should counselors manage turn-taking during virtual counseling sessions?,"During virtual counseling sessions, counselors should establish an agreement with the client on how to take turns in speaking. This agreement is important to ensure respectful and effective communication between the counselor and the client. It prevents interruptions and allows each party to express themselves fully. By setting clear guidelines on turn-taking, both the counselor and the client can engage in a balanced and productive conversation."
What should counselors do when a client experiences a breakdown during a virtual counseling session?,"When a client experiences a breakdown during a virtual counseling session, counselors should have a pre-agreed process in place for handling such situations. This process should be clearly communicated to the client in advance, ensuring that they are aware of what to expect. Counselors may provide techniques such as deep breathing exercises to help the client regulate their emotions and create a safe space for them to express their concerns. It is essential for the counselor to be empathetic, supportive, and responsive to the client's needs during this time."
Why are keywords important in virtual counseling sessions?,"Keywords are important in virtual counseling sessions as they can be used as code words to indicate potential interruptions or sensitive situations. For example, if a client feels unsafe or believes someone may be listening, they can use a pre-determined keyword (e.g., ""whoa"") to signal the need for privacy or confidentiality. This helps maintain the safety and confidentiality of the counseling session, ensuring that the client feels secure in sharing their thoughts and concerns."

6.1.2. Accomplished evaluation sheet, providing an assessment of the student intern's performance during the internship.
6.1.3. Other pertinent reports, information, and/or documents that describe the student intern's performances and are deemed necessary for evaluation purposes."
What is the basis for the student intern's final grade?,"The SIPP Coordinator's report, along with the HTE evaluation report, serves as the basis for the student intern's final grade. These reports assess the student intern's performance throughout the internship period."
" What happens if a student intern's contract is terminated before the end of the stipulated period?"," If a student intern's contract is terminated before the end of the stipulated period due to other causes, the student intern will still be given a final grade based on the school's grading system. The circumstances surrounding the termination will be taken into consideration when determining the final grade"
How strictly are these guidelines monitored by LSPU?,"LSPU is committed to strict monitoring and compliance with these guidelines. The university ensures that the internship program follows the established procedures and guidelines, and they monitor HTEs and student interns to ensure adherence to the agreed-upon standards and responsibilities."
What is the procedure for local OJT/internship?,"The procedure for local OJT/internship includes the following steps:

7.1. The OJT/SIPP Coordinator prepares an endorsement letter to the agency/institution, endorsing the students for OJT/internship.

7.2. Only officially enrolled students who meet the requirements and evaluation of their grades or academic standing during enrollment are allowed to undergo OJT/internship.

7.3. The student submits a medical certificate as required by the company.

7.4. The OJT/SIPP Coordinator conducts an in-house orientation, providing information on the policies and procedures for conducting the OJT. Relevant forms and documents are distributed during this orientation.

7.5. The OJT/SIPP Coordinator endorses the students to the Dean and VPAA for approval. After approval, the coordinator packages the necessary documents, such as the Training Needs Form, request letter for the conduct of OJT, Memorandum of Agreement, among others, for submission and endorsement to the institution/agency.

7.6. The OJT/SIPP Coordinator conducts regular monitoring of the OJT students or interns.

7.7. Assessment and evaluation of the OJT is done by requiring the student to submit pertinent documents such as a daily time record, evaluation form, certificate of completion, among others.

7.8. A presentation of the Narrative Report may be conducted. After revision based on the comments/suggestions of the panel, a soft-bound copy is submitted to the OJT/SIPP Coordinator."
How are internship fees determined?,"LSPU follows the approved students' internship fee based on CHED Memorandum Order No. 3, Series of 2012 (CMO No. 03, s. 2012), which governs the policies, guidelines, and procedures for increasing tuition and other school fees, introducing new fees, and other related purposes. The school cannot charge fees other than the approved/prescribed fee or other school fees duly noted by CHED. The internship fee includes administrative costs that correspond to the units of the practicum/OJT subject and complements the administrative costs of LSPU."
What is the grievance machinery for the program?,"To address grievances and complaints related to the program, a Grievance Committee is constituted. The committee consists of officials, the SIPP Coordinator, and the dean and/or representative of the concerned college of LSPU that has jurisdiction over the student intern. The committee is responsible for investigating and settling differences in cases of violation of the training agreement or upon filing a complaint by an aggrieved party. If the Grievance Committee fails to settle an issue or render a decision, it may be referred to the concerned CHEDRO (Commission on Higher Education Regional Office) for appropriate action. Once a resolution or decision is recommended or taken, the parties involved are informed accordingly, considering the nature and confidentiality of the grievance/resolution."
How should counselors handle emerging criminal activities during virtual counseling sessions?,"Counselors should be prepared to address emerging criminal activities during virtual counseling sessions. It is important for counselors to have a list of relevant organizations or resources that can assist in dealing with such situations. Establishing networks with auxiliary personnel, such as law enforcement or legal authorities, can be helpful. If the counselor becomes aware of criminal activities during a session, they should follow the appropriate reporting procedures and provide guidance to the client on how to seek assistance from the appropriate authorities."
What should counselors and clients do when the connection is cut during a virtual counseling session?,"In the event of a disconnection during a virtual counseling session, counselors should explain the protocol to the client beforehand. The counselor can guide the client on what to do in case of a disconnection, such as attempting to reconnect within a specified timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes). If reconnection is not possible due to ongoing connection issues or other problems, counselors should have a backup plan in place. This could involve contacting the client through alternative means, such as telephone or an alternative contact number, to continue the session and ensure continuity of care."
How should virtual counseling sessions be ended?,"At the end of a virtual counseling session, the client should end the video call when they have said goodbye. If the client decides to end the session, counselors should respect their decision and note that the client chose to end the session for their own sake. It is important to have an agreement or understanding between the counselor and the client regarding session endings to ensure mutual respect and clear communication."

What are the client breakdown protocols?,"Protocols � includes the details (time), procedures turn takings, during client�s breakdown, keywords, emerging criminal activities, what to do when the connection is cut, and how to end the session. 
2.2.2. Turn takings � it is a challenge on how to take turns in virtual counseling. Make an agreement with the client who to speak as a show of respect to each other and to not preempt the flow of discussion and information. 

2.2.3. During the client�s breakdown � what to do? Form an agreement on the process of handling breakdown. A process must be clear to the client. The counselor may provide deep breathing techniques to place the client�s emotional state at a evel that the client can express and extend his/her problems clearly. o Keywords � client and counselor must have a code word (e.g. whoa) that may be used when someone is there that may cause interruption, might as well to maintain safetyand confidentiality in terms of client�s disclosures. 
2.2.4. Emerging criminal activities � be prepared. As this event arise be ready with the list of organizations better suited to dealing with the situation. Establishing networks through auxiliary personnel is relevant. 

2.2.5. What to do when the connection is cut? � explain to your client the protocol when this happens. As the service provider, it is best to guide your client on what to do. Give each other time to reconnect (e.g. 5 minutes).

that I am not obliged to participate in any counseling sessions and that the counselor respects my decision. Though I am aware that this termi-
nation will not end the Guidance Office services as I am aware that their services are always open for their students."
What is the Target Delivery Mode for Flexible Learning?,"The LSPU Flexible Learning is an institutional response to the current 
and future challenges in instructional delivery. Using the results of the survey 
of the OVPAA and CIDQA Unit, flexible learning is contextually categorized: -2.1. Synchronous Online � learning is real-time via Internet 

2.2. Asynchronous Online � students learn at different times and locations, no real-time interactions with Internet requirements (via 
LMS, discussion forum, self-guided materials, prerecorded videos) 
2.3. E-Learning Offline � students are using digital learning resources package offline while NOT connected to Internet"
What is the definition of flexible learning?,"1.1 Flexible Learning is the design and delivery of programs, courses, and learning interventions that address learners� unique needs in terms of place, pace, process, and products of learning. It involves the use of digital and non-digital technology, and covers both face- to-face/in-person learning and out-of-classroom learning modes of delivery or a combination of modes of delivery. It ensures the conti- nuity of inclusive and accessible education when the use of tradi- tional modes of teachings not feasible, as in the occurrence of national emergencies (CHEd, 2020). 

1.2. Flexible Learning is a pedagogical approach allowing flexibility of time, place and audience including, but not solely focused on, the use of technology. Although it commonly uses the delivery methods 
of distance education and facilities of education technology, this may vary depending on the levels of technology, availability of devices, internet connectivity, level of digital literacy and approaches (SEAMEO)."
What are the guidelines for helping teachers transition to online learning?,"While faculty are expected to be proactive and reflective in their teaching practice in face-to-face settings, it is really challenging for them to migrate to the new teaching and learning environment. Crucial to the approaches ou
lined below is the provision of an opportunity to explore potentialities of e- learning, by establishing a complete migration learning plan, designing and de-veloping an e-learning module from the migration plan template, and translating the e-learning module to the LSPU platform. Here are some guidelines to help teachers transition to online learning: Step 1. Cluster subjects based on learning outcomes and disciplinal content.
The Faculty may conduct curriculum mapping to cluster the subjects according to the nature of the discipline. Some subjects may also remain stand-alone.

Step 2. Examine the syllabi and review course intended learning outcomes. The University Cluster Curriculum Review Committee (UCCRC) com- posed of the VPAA, CIDQA, Dean / Associate Dean, Program Coordinator, Subject Matter Expert, GAD Unit, and ITSO Unit, will examine and calibrate the soundness, appropriateness, and gender sensitivity of the identified Essential Intended Learning Outcomes.
Step 3. Complete migration learning plan template. The Migration E-Learning Course Plan should be accomplished by all faculty of each course as soon as they receive their teaching load for the incoming semester/
term. It will be submitted to the UCCRC for review and evaluation. The CIDQA Chairperson will endorse the accomplished Template to the CIDQA for recommendation to the Vice � President for Academic
Affairs (VPAA) for approval. The VPAA may approve the Migration Learning Plan Template at least two (2) weeks before the opening of classes.
Step 4. Design and develop a module from the migration plan template 4.1 LSPU Course GuideThe Course Guide is a document which serves as the learner�s guide in completing the course. It contains the general information about the course and what students need to pass the course. Further, it serves as a learning contract between the teacher and the students directly lifted and migrated from the OBE Syllabi.
4.2 LSPU Self-Paced Learning Module The university shall adopt the Self-Paced Learning Module (SLM) which was crafted during the Webinar Workshop. These e-learning materials, designed both for online and offline modes, are based on the essential competencies identified in a course. In the preparation of SLM, an established and unique identity for LSPU shall be adopted. Hence, its acronym could be described as: Leaning Outcomes. These pertain to the identified high essential learning competencies lifted from the OBE course syllabus that the teacher wishes students to perform after finishing the learning
course or unit.
Student Learning Strategies. Flexible learning is self-paced and self- directed, the IMs to be produced shall characterize as personalized 
learning by using it as a tool to adapt to student capabilities. The teacher determines the approach for achieving the learning objectives and are included in the pre-instructional activities, and lesson presentation adopting flexible learning options. Performance Tasks. These are the activities that require the learners to perform the task or activity to standards. It will give students an 
experience for engagement attuned to the community of practice. Understanding directed assessment. Assessment is done through 
faculty marked exams, portfolios, reflective/synthesis papers, research papers, projects, and innovative tools, among others. 

Step 5. Google Classroom will be institutionalized as primary LSPU LMS platform and parameters on its use to support course delivery will bemade available to faculty."
What is a modified grading policy?,"The Modified Grading Policy During the pandemic, shall be observed:
4.1. The university will continue using the numerical grading system for
all students;
4.2. In preparation for the non-face-to-face conduct of teaching and learning, the university shall still adopt the grading system stated in the Student Handbook.

4.3. The bases for the computation of grades used in the grading system for each grading period may include quizzes, recitation/participation, course requirements, activity sheets/projects. However, the New Normal permits the academic community to modify each grade. Hence, based on the online Self-paced Learning Module, the following components for the computation of grades shall be adopted:

4.3.1. Synchronous/Asynchronous: Course discussion � 20%; Ac-tivities/Performance Task 40% Final Exam /Outputs �40% 4.3.2. E-learning Offline/Remote Modular: Activities/
Performance Task� 50%; Final Exam/Outputs � 50% The Offices of Graduate Studies Applied Research shall determine the parameters for the assessment of their students' academic performance, taking into consideration the current situation.

4.5. The GSAR may also adopt the grading system for undergraduate students."
What does it mean to safeguard the integrity of assessment?,"5.1. Assessment of learning outcomes, regardless of the mode of learning and teaching will follow the requirements and standards that have been developed by the faculty and adopted by the University. 
5.2. These requirements and standards will be uniform and not vary across different courses regardless of the degree of flexibility they may integrate as part of the learning and teaching transaction in any mode of study. 
5.3. All formal course examinations taken by students, as part of any mode of study, will be proctored and may be taken online. 
5.4. Course work and assessment items undertaken and/or submitted online will be authenticated with procedures and processes, in- cluding tools such as Turnitin, to ensure that all online learning activities are valid and undertaken by the registered student. 
5.5. Student Manual may be revisited regarding the rules on cheating and its consequences. 
5.6. Students may sign an Honesty Form where students commit thatThe answers came from them without relying on others and with knowledge of consequences when caught dishonest, and attested by parents, if possible. 
5.7. Students may sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement attested by the parents to minimize the spreading of the assessment tool."
What are quality assurance measures in an educational context?,"Monitoring, Review, and Assessment of Instructional Materials

What does monitoring faculty presence mean in the context of ensuring quality learning?,"Faculty presence shall be monitored in two ways depending on the level of community quarantine declaration: (1) when residential instruction is allowed, faculty attendance will be monitored by their presence in their respective classes; and (2) when the community quarantine declaration requires students to stay at home, faculty presence shall be monitored through a progress report on the achievement of their students through thehome or distant learning using the learning modules.

The following documents shall be submitted by the faculty at the end of each month. They shall be used as proof that services are rendered by the faculty:
3.1. Pilot Testing Results of the Self-paced Learning Module through the Survey Questionnaire accomplished by all students enrolled in the class (LSPU � CQA � SF � 011). (See Annex A)

3.2. Accomplishment Report that documents the classes being conducted synchronously or asynchronously/e-learning offline OR

Student�s Progress Report, of all classes handled, if the mode of instructional delivery is purely home or distant learning using the printed module; and
3.3. Faculty Daily Time Record, when limited face-to-face instruction is taking place.
3.4. Before the semester ends, the teaching effectiveness of all faculty will be gauged through LSPU � CQA � SF � 012 (Criteria for
Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness in Flexible Learning) to be accomplished by at least 10 students (through the Program Coordinator), Dean/Associate Dean, CIDQA, and VPAA."
What is an internship/practicum?,"University Policy on On-the-job Training (OJT)/Practicum/Internship 
1.1. No student shall return to their respective field to continue with their OJT/Practicum/Internship. 
1.2. The incomplete period/time accomplished by the student for OJT/practicum/internship may adopt alternative learning opportunities to be used for implementation and assessment in the completion of the supposed exposure. 

1.3. Where it is applicable, the final task regarding OJT/practicum/ internship may make use online and live video presentations (e.g., via Zoom) duly arranged by the teacher-in-charge/adviser for proper management and assessment (e.g., final demonstration for education). 
1.4. For courses with the required number of hours of OJT/ practicum/internship such as B.S. Nursing, the college may opt for the inter-semester hours to complete the essential subject re- quirements, and adjustments are made for other subjects to be taken in other semesters (Curriculum Shift, CHED 2020). 
1.5. In recognition of the uniqueness of each college/department, any exceptional cases wherein the abovementioned procedures for OJT/practicum/internship are not applicable, may be consultedand deliberated with the Academic Affairs Office. 
1.6. A work-from-home scheme could be adopted, that is, OJT/Internship/Practicum of students could be done inside the University campus. The campus could establish a simulated workplace(e.g., offices, physical plant and facilities for engineering students,etc.). However, using a virtual laboratory equipment would cost so much, hence, it shall be advised that the focus of the first term of the curriculum contents would be on theories, concepts, and principles. The second semester would see to the applications of those skills and a request for an extension of laboratory hours shall be allowed."
What is the purpose of conducting research and extension/production in an educational institution?,"In view of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic particularly with the imposition of the Modified General Community Quarantine in the province of Laguna by the national government, faculty researchers and extensionists are
dvised to be guided with the relevant protocols and guidelines that were issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force and the Office of the University President in the conduct or implementation of their respective research and development-related activities. This is to ensure for the safety and of the other university personnel and the public, in general, during this health crisis. Specificconcerns regarding the implementation of the duly approved research programs/projects/studies at this point in time can be directed to the Office of the Director of Research and Development via email atrd_siniloan@lspu.edu.ph. (LSPU-RDOMEMO-006; October 13, 2020). Research Development at the present time is much needed and inevitable. In the light of the existing National Health Emergency Situation in the country, LSPU must be proactive in innovating measures that will support the fight against COVID 19.
